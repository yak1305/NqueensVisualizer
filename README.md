N-Queens Visualizer

Overview

The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial puzzle where the objective is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project is a visualizer for the N-Queens problem, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive and intuitive way to explore the backtracking algorithm used to solve this problem, with a dynamic visual representation of the chessboard and the placement of queens.

Features

Interactive Chessboard: A visually appealing chessboard interface that updates in real-time as queens are placed.

Algorithm Visualization: Watch the backtracking algorithm in action as it tries to place queens, backtracks on conflicts, and finds solutions.

Multiple Solutions Display: Discover all possible solutions for a given board size (N).

Customizable Board Size: Easily set the size of the chessboard and see how the algorithm handles different scenarios.

Control Panel: Adjust the speed of the visualization, start or pause the algorithm, and reset the board.
